# tank-game

A clone of an old tank game that was one of the first videogames I remember playing back on our first home PC.  That one was written in BASIC; this one is written in Lisp!

## Usage

FIXME: write instructions for slightly long-winded Clojure invocation

TODO: Add shell script to handle the aforementioned invocation

## Installation

<strike>None!</strike>  You have to clone it or otherwise acquire tanks.clj and DynaFrame.class, and put them in the right place, and... ugh.  Cloning is probably easier.  If there's enough interest I might get around to making a proper executable Uberjar, but for now it's just a hobby project that I've mostly finished up.  (I do, however, intend to at least flesh out the Usage section so that brave souls may stand a chance of getting it working ^_^; )
